Week 6 was dedicated to our front end project. For once, everything felt simple and went smoothly, apart from github. However, after seeing Sean help us fix the issues, it started to make more sense and felt more natural to push/pull to main. I was very excited to have our project completed and I'm really thankful to have hardworking group members to help me when I'm feeling unsure about something.
