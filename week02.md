At the end of week 2 we began our first group projects in python. The scale of the project seems so much bigger than the smaller exercises we've done in class, but its crazy how much it all makes sense and fits together. As we were discussing what features include in our project I was able to quickly come up with solutions for them, looking back on previous work on features I was not too sure on.

I decided to join Digitalcrafts because it seemed like the best career option for me. I was anxious for a change in life and felt that returning to college for another 2 years would be too much to bear. I considered other careers but still wanted something I would be happy doing. I was drawn to Digitalcrafts because it was a relatively short experience and the reviews online emphasized growth in knowledge and help after the end of the cohort. While 16 weeks is a lot of time to spend heavily focusing on one thing, it was easily the best option for me and I am very glad I made this decision.
