Week 4 we worked with Javascript and APIs. I am starting to see so many uses for what we are learning in class and recognize them any time I visit a website. I wish I had as many ideas as the complaints I usually have about things, but they just never come to me. Most of the ideas that come to me that would make things easier tend to be for video games. I have looked into making small mobile games that require a bit of programming, so hopefully I can set time aside to learn C# and start a side project.
