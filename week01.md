Week 1 of our cohort is finished and I am already impressed at the information I was actually able to retain. I was extremely worried the class would feel too fast paced for me, especially considering I have always struggled to study on my own, but so far I have been able to apply what I know to solve the problems our coding exercises present. I have joined two other classes to watch their project presentations and now look to the future of our class with excitement. Their projects all looked big and complex, but I look forward to reaching those levels.
