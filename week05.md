Week 5 consisted of more API work and some bootstrap. This week is when fetching from API's really started to click for me. I worked on a few exercises outside of class and was able to do most of it with little issues. Bootstrap was also very cool to see. A friend of mine had told me about it but it was not what I expected. Its useful to have pre-made layouts that I can choose from, but now that I'm a bit more comfortable with CSS styling, it feels limiting. If there ever comes a time when I have no idea how to style a page the way I want it to be, I will definitely rely on bootstrap.

Group projects have always been hit or miss for me. Depending on how comfortable I am on the subject, I usually try to take lead for planning/organizing. Our Python project was a learning experience for me, as I was still new to python but had to make sure I knew what was required from me to make it all fit together.
