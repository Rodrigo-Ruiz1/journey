This week was our career prep week. I was nervous about getting a resume together, as I felt I did not have much to show, but I think it turned out pretty well. Wish I had more relevant work experience but I hope the work on my projects is enough to make me a considerable candidate.

Portfolio turned out pretty well. I still want to try creating a portfolio on my own once we finish the cohort, but even working on a template reminded me of how time consuming CSS styling can be.

The practice interviews was very helpful. I always get flustered when talking about myself, and it did not help to be in a group, but I picked up a few things from my classmates.
